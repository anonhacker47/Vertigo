> **⚠ Disclaimer ⚠**: Vertigo is WIP and under active development. Expect occasional bugs, incomplete features, and potential breaking changes as I add new features and improve functionality. Only the basic CRUD is done till now.

## Goals:
- A responsive modern web app to track and curate physical comicbook collection
- Search and filter options based on various criteria such as title, publisher etc.
- Track reading progress (read/unread, backlog and ratings if needed).
